ONE-TIME SECRET


## Generating a global secret

With encryption_v2 (2012-01-07) we include a global secret in the encryption key so it needs to be long and secure (that's what she said). One approach:

history | ruby -ropenssl -rgibbler -e 'Gibbler.digest_type = OpenSSL::Digest::SHA256; puts [`/usr/bin/uname -a`, $$, Time.now.to_f, ARGF.read].gibbler.base(36)'
