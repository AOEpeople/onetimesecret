* Hugo+some other guy: don't log IP addresses in nginx. [We should keep the logs the same but delete them instead of rotating. Only keep a few hours or a day for operational purposes.]

* Delano: We could do a callback feature to help with forgot password implementations. So when a secret is retrieved, make a callback to some URI with that secret's key

  * @solutious i use it for fixing failed pressbooks user activation ... manually adding an autogen'd pw, & sending new login deets to user.
* This is absolutely fantastic! Before we were using Gmail's "off the record" but it felt clunky. This is elegant and fast. Well done sirs! [99.116.238.89]

OneTimeSecret... actually, yeah, I often need to share passwords with people and don't want it in either my email archives or theirs. Great idea. Somehow I didn't 'get' it at first, it took a couple passes at the idea. I think the way my brain works, if it was explained as a way to share "sensitive information" (rather than secrets) I might have understood it faster. For some reason 'secrets' didn't bring to mind passwords. But it's entirely possible that it's just a quirk of my brain.

How are you thinking of showing it visually? I am imagining screenshots of email / IM windows where people are sharing passwords, but the passwords are then circled or hiliteed in red... "Keep passwords out of your email and IM logs. Use OneTimeSecret to share sensitive information... without leaving a trace." Just a thought.
