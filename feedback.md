OneTimeSecret... actually, yeah, I often need to share passwords with people and don't want it in either my email archives or theirs. Great idea. Somehow I didn't 'get' it at first, it took a couple passes at the idea. I think the way my brain works, if it was explained as a way to share "sensitive information" (rather than secrets) I might have understood it faster. For some reason 'secrets' didn't bring to mind passwords. But it's entirely possible that it's just a quirk of my brain.

How are you thinking of showing it visually? I am imagining screenshots of email / IM windows where people are sharing passwords, but the passwords are then circled or highlighted in red... "Keep passwords out of your email and IM logs. Use OneTimeSecret to share sensitive information... without leaving a trace." Just a thought.
