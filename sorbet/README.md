The sorbet/ folder should exist and look something like this:

â”œâ”€â”€ config             # Default options to be passed to Sorbet on every run
â””â”€â”€ rbi/
  â”œâ”€â”€ annotations/     # Type definitions pulled from the rbi-central repository
  â”œâ”€â”€ gems/            # Autogenerated type definitions for your gems
  â””â”€â”€ todo.rbi         # Constants which were still missing after RBI generation
â””â”€â”€ tapioca/
  â”œâ”€â”€ config.yml       # Default options to be passed to Tapioca
  â””â”€â”€ require.rb       # A file where you can make requires from gems that might be needed for gem RBI generation

Please check this folder into version control.

ðŸ¤” What's next

1. Many Ruby applications use metaprogramming DSLs to dynamically generate constants and methods.
  To generate type definitions for any DSLs in your application, run:

  bin/tapioca dsl

2. Check whether the constants in the sorbet/rbi/todo.rbi file actually exist in your project.
  It is possible that some of these constants are typos, and leaving them in todo.rbi will
  hide errors in your application. Ideally, you should be able to remove all definitions
  from this file and delete it.

3. Typecheck your project:

  bundle exec srb tc

  There should not be any typechecking errors.

4. Upgrade a file marked "# typed: false" to "# typed: true".
  Then, run: bundle exec srb tc and try to fix any errors.

  You can use Spoom to bump files for you:

  spoom bump --from false --to true

5. Add signatures to your methods with sig. To learn how, read: https://sorbet.org/docs/sigs
