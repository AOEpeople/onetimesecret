    <h3>F.A.Q.</h3>

    <h4>Why would I use this?</h4>
    <p>When you send people passwords and private links via email or chat, there are copies of that information stored in many places. If you use a one-time link instead, the information persists for a single viewing which means it can't be read by someone else later. This allows you to send sensitive information in a safe way knowing it's seen by one person only. Think of it like a self-destructing message.</p>

    <h4>Can I retrieve a secret that has already been shared?</h4>
    <p>Nope. We display it once and then delete it. After that it's gone forever.</p>

    <h4>How long do you keep non-viewed secrets?</h4>
    <p>We keep secrets for up to 7 days for anonymous users and up to 30 days for <a href="/signup">free accounts</a>. After that they are deleted automatically and gone forever. (Note: viewed secrets are deleted immediately.)</p>

    <h4>What is the maximum message size?</h4>
    <p>The maximum size is 25KB for anonymous users, 50KB for <a href="/signup">free accounts</a>, and more for paid.</p>

    <h4>Why should I trust you?</h4>
    <p>General we can't do anything with your information even if we wanted to (which we don't). If it's a password for example, we don't know the username or even the application that the credentials are for.</p>
    <p>If you include a passphrase (available under "Privacy Options"), we use it to encrypt the secret. We don't store the passphrase (only a bcrypted hash) so we can never know what the secret is because we can't decrypt it.</p>
    <p>Beside all that, the code is <a href="https://github.com/onetimesecret/onetimesecret">opensource</a> so you can review the code and/or run your own instance.</p>
