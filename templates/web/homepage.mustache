      <h3>F.A.Q.</h3>
      
      <h4>Why would I use this?</h4>
      <p>When you send people passwords and private links via email or chat, there are copies of that information stored in many places. If you use a one-time link instead, the information persists for a single viewing which means it can't be read by someone else later. This allows you to send sensitive information in a safe way knowing it's seen by one person only. Think of it like a self-destructing message.</p>
      
      <h4>Can I retrieve a secret that has already been shared?</h4>
      <p>Nope. We display it once and then delete it. After that it's gone forever.</p>
      
      <h4>How long do you keep non-viewed secrets?</h4>
      <p>We keep secrets that haven't been viewed for 7 days. After that they are deleted automatically and gone forever. (Note: secrets that have been viewed are deleted immediately.)</p>
      
      <h4>Why should I trust you?</h4>
      <p>In addition to being really cool guys, we can't really do anything with your information. If it's a password for example, we don't know the username or even the application that the credentials are for.</p>
      <p>If you include a passphrase (available under "More options"), we use it to encrypt the secret. We don't store the passphrase (only a bcrypted hash) so we can never know what the secret is because we can't decrypt it.</p>
